1. Morphometric Analysis
DLBCL nuclei were significantly larger and more elongated than ENKTCL nuclei, with increased nuclear area (p < 0.0001), perimeter (p < 0.0001), and eccentricity (p = 0.0052). Circularity showed no significant difference (p = 0.1195). 
Hematoxylin mean optical density was markedly higher in DLBCL (p < 0.0001), indicating stronger staining intensity.
