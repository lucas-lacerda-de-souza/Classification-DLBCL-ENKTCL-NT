📊 Summary of Results
1. Morphometric Analysis
DLBCL nuclei were significantly larger and more elongated than ENKTCL nuclei, with increased nuclear area (p < 0.0001), perimeter (p < 0.0001), and eccentricity (p = 0.0052). Circularity showed no significant difference (p = 0.1195). 
Hematoxylin mean optical density was markedly higher in DLBCL (p < 0.0001), indicating stronger staining intensity.

2. Traditional Machine Learning (Clinicopathological + Morphometric Features)
XGBoost achieved:
Accuracy: 0.829
AUC: 0.945
F1-score: 0.829
Precision: 0.810
Recall: 0.850
SHAP analysis revealed age, nuclear area, and nuclear hematoxylin OD mean as the most influential features. These were integrated into the multimodal framework used for deep learning classification.

These results provide a clinical benchmark, showing that the best-performing models (especially ResNet50 + Segmentation) reach or exceed expert-level concordance.

✅ Final Summary for GitHub
This study demonstrates that integrating morphometric analysis, traditional ML, deep learning, and segmentation-enhanced multimodal pipelines provides highly accurate differentiation between DLBCL and ENKTCL. 
The ResNet50 + segmented patches model achieved the best and most stable performance across all internal and external validations, surpassing standard CNN architectures and approaching expert-level diagnostic agreement.
