📊 Summary of Results
1. Morphometric Analysis
DLBCL nuclei were significantly larger and more elongated than ENKTCL nuclei, with increased nuclear area (p < 0.0001), perimeter (p < 0.0001), and eccentricity (p = 0.0052). Circularity showed no significant difference (p = 0.1195). 
Hematoxylin mean optical density was markedly higher in DLBCL (p < 0.0001), indicating stronger staining intensity.

2. Traditional Machine Learning (Clinicopathological + Morphometric Features)
XGBoost achieved:
Accuracy: 0.829
AUC: 0.945
F1-score: 0.829
Precision: 0.810
Recall: 0.850
SHAP analysis revealed age, nuclear area, and nuclear hematoxylin OD mean as the most influential features. These were integrated into the multimodal framework used for deep learning classification.

5. Grad-CAM Morphological Classification

XGBoost trained on Grad-CAM–derived features:
Training accuracy: 0.926
Internal validation accuracy: 0.776
External validation accuracy: 0.817
External AUC: 0.847
Results indicate good generalisation when applied to previously unseen Grad-CAM morphological profiles.

6. Pathologist Benchmark

Two expert pathologists evaluated the same cases:

Pathologist 1
Accuracy: 65.4%
F1-score: 0.704

Pathologist 2
Accuracy: 60.3%
F1-score: 0.635

Agreement
Interobserver agreement was fair, with Cohen’s κ = 0.296 (95% CI: 0.135–0.458).
Concordance with the reference diagnosis was also modest:
• Pathologist 1: κ = 0.309
• Pathologist 2: κ = 0.206

These findings illustrate the inherent diagnostic difficulty of distinguishing DLBCL from ENKTCL-NT based solely on morphology. Notably, the best-performing AI models—particularly the 
segmentation-enhanced ResNet50 and Grad-CAM-informed pipelines—surpassed expert-level accuracy and concordance, demonstrating their potential to provide robust diagnostic support in challenging lymphoma cases.

✅ Final Summary for GitHub
This study demonstrates that integrating morphometric analysis, traditional ML, deep learning, and segmentation-enhanced multimodal pipelines provides highly accurate differentiation between DLBCL and ENKTCL. 
The ResNet50 + segmented patches model achieved the best and most stable performance across all internal and external validations, surpassing standard CNN architectures and approaching expert-level diagnostic agreement.
