**1. Project Overview**

Multimodal AI pipeline for classifying DLBCL vs. ENKTCL using three data streams: (1) histopathology patches processed with CNN + MLP fusion, (2) structured clinicopathologic data, and (3) morphometric nuclear features evaluated with XGBoost + SHAP. Interpretability is provided through Grad-CAM and SHAP-based explanations.
